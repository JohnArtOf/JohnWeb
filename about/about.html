                <h5>About John</h5>
                <p>John was raised in Augusta Georgia where their were not many opportunities to find success as
an artist. He was never really encouraged to be an artist. But his natural ability to transform his
words into visual images was evident as a young kid. John was able to draw images after
reading and listening to subjects in school such as history and science. Glover has always
specialized in telling a story with his compositions. Creating images has always been part of his
way of communicating. In high school he became the most visible artist in the school without
ever taking in art class until his senior year. John moved on to college trying to find a way to use
his natural ability to render images as a career choice.
Today John Glover is a prolific artist who works had a frantic pace. John believes that he has a
story to tell and very little time to tell it. Some have said that John paints as if he&#39;s running away
from something. But the question maybe is he really running away or is he just running towards
his purpose.</p>
                    <h5>About Art</h5>
                    <p>The elevation work is The idea that we often reach our spiritual height and thinking. This work is
based on a visually pleasing composition that shows the physical mind is elevated. Although we
know that the mental process is only visual in our imaginations. With that in mind, building a
composition that shows a physical manifestation of an elevated mind is what is shown in this
work. In writing about elevated thoughts, words would better explain the composition. With the
visual arts images are our words. The neck is used as a platform to lift the head which houses
the brain where We understand the thought process takes place. Therefore, this is how the
elevation of the mind concept is thought of.</p>
